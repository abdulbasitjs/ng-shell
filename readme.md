git clone http://10.0.8.169:7990/scm/sp/single-portal-frontend.git
My code is ready to be pushed
If you already have code ready to be pushed to this repository then run this in your terminal.

cd existing-project
git init
git add --all
git commit -m "Initial Commit"
git remote add origin http://10.0.8.169:7990/scm/sp/single-portal-frontend.git
git push -u origin master
My code is already tracked by Git
If your code is already tracked by Git then set this repository as your "origin" to push to.

cd existing-project
git remote set-url origin http://10.0.8.169:7990/scm/sp/single-portal-frontend.git
git push -u origin --all
git push origin --tags
All done with the commands?
